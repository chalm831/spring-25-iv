          This section summarizes the insights uncovered during the analysis of color trends in luxury fashion against economic performance. While initial hypotheses focused on a direct correlation between downturns and increased use of <span class="highlight-red">red</span>, the findings reveal a more nuanced relationship influenced by broader design strategies, market resilience, and cultural shifts.

        <h2 class="centered-heading">1. Red Usage Shows Long-Term Growth, Not Short-Term Reaction</h2>
        <div class="visualization-description">
          <p>
            Although bold colors like <span class="highlight-red">red</span> were expected to spike during economic downturns, data indicates a steady increase over time, regardless of immediate financial conditions. This suggests that the adoption of emotionally charged colors is part of a gradual evolution in luxury fashion rather than a reactive tactic to market instability.

        <h2 class="centered-heading">2. Neutrals Dominate but Yield Slightly After Recessions</h2>
        <div class="visualization-description">
          <p>
            Neutral tones such as black, gray, and beige remain the backbone of luxury collections. However, slight decreases in their dominance post-recession hint at designers embracing more expressive palettes during recovery periods, possibly to reignite consumer excitement.

        <h2 class="centered-heading">3. Economic Downturns Act as Design Inflection Points</h2>
        <div class="visualization-description">
          <p>
            While no direct year-to-year correlation was found, both the 2008 and 2020 downturns marked shifts in how color was used in subsequent years. These periods appear to encourage experimentation and boldness once stability begins to return.
